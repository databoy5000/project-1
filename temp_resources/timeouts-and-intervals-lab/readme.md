# setTimeout and setInterval lab 

In the starter code is a single HTML document, stylesheet and JS file (comment in the JS code to begin). If you open the `index.html` in the browser you'll see two watch faces.

#### Clock

The first watch face is a simple clock:

1. Add the current time to the watch face when the page is loaded (in the format `HH:MM:SS`)
2. Make the clock tick every second.

#### Timer

The second watch face is a timer with start and reset buttons

1. Make the timer start when you click the black start button
1. When the timer reaches 0, add the class of `ringing` to the timer to make it shake
1. Reset the timer when you click the red reset button
